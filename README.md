Riot_API_crawler

Used for our 7th semester project in which we developed a recommendation system for League of Legends champion combinations.

Provided with a single account this crawler collects their match history data and then collectes data from all other players in these matches and so on. This data was used to train a neural net used for game state prediction in our neural net: Given your x/5 currently selected champions on both your and you opponents team, if some given champion is added to your team, how is your chances of winning.
